# Jacuzzi (SPA Web Server)

Jacuzzi is a simple (http & http2) web server for serving SPA (Single Page Applications).
Jacuzzi is built with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) on top of [Warp](https://crates.io/crates/warp).

### Why is Jacuzzi good for Serving SPA (Single Page Applications)
Jacuzzi is configured to return the `index.html` file for any GET request that would normally return a 404 (not found). 
You can point Jacuzzi at a directory with `index.html` in it's root and it will serve all content `inside` that directory 
normally. Any unknown GET request path that would normally 404 will instead 200 with the content of `index.html`. 
This allows the router to detect the route and serve the correct content.
